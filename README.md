### Short script description

To run LM-BFF in a similar fashion to the initial study, the main github (https://github.com/princeton-nlp/LM-BFF/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) was followed for set-up retreiving the results from each run.

Implementation of AlBERT involved adjusting the models.py & run.py code. Similarly, running PubMed20k involved adjusting the code so that it could account for the novel dataset. This included the code sections, and the bash files.

To download the datasets used in this project, please follow the instructions on the github, and for PubMed20k, please download from (https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/pubmed-rct)
